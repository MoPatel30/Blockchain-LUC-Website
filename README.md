## Blockchain@LUC Website

This is the official website for the Blockchain@LUC SSO for Loyola University Chicago students 
to explore all things Bitcoin and BLockchain.


This project is currently a website mainly for information regarding the club. In the future, this site will become more of
a web-app where users can progress through certain fundamental courses to learn the basics of bitcoin & blockchain on the side. 


Educational content will be provided in the "Education" section and members can learn the basics of bitcoin and blockchain at
their own pace.
