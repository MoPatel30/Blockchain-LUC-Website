## Blockchain@LUC Website
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the official website for the Blockchain@LUC club for Loyola University Chicago students 
to explore all things Bitcoin and BLockchain.

This website was coded in ReactJS, HTML/CSS

This project is currently a website mainly for information. In the future, this site will become more of
a web-app where users can take certain fundamental courses to learn bitcoin & blockchain on the side (if they wish to, obviously).
