This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the official website for the Blockchain@LUC club for Loyola University Chicago students 
to explore all things Bitcoin and BLockchain.

This website was coded in ReactJS, HTML/CSS

This project is currently a website mainly for information. In the future, this site will become more of
a web-app where users can take certain fundamental courses to learn bitcoin & blockchain on the side (if they wish to, obviously)


The creator of this repo/project is me, Mohammed Patel. I am a current sophomore at LUC majoring in Computer Science and Data Science.I fell in love with blockchain in high school and am fortunate enough to be a part of the Blockchain club and be able to create one of the very first projects that'll help bring blockchain to Loyola's campuses.
